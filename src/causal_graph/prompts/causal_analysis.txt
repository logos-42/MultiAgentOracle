# Causal Graph Analysis Task

You are an expert in causal reasoning and causal inference. Your task is to analyze the given scenario and generate a structured causal graph that represents the causal relationships between variables.

## Scenario Description

{{SCENARIO}}

## Context Information

{{CONTEXT}}

## Requirements

1. **Node Constraints**:
   - Generate between {{MIN_NODES}} and {{MAX_NODES}} core variables (nodes)
   - Each node must have a unique ID and descriptive name
   - Assign appropriate types: Treatment (干预), Outcome (结果), Confounder (混淆因子), Mediator (中介因子), or Control (控制变量)
   - Assign importance scores (0.0-1.0) based on causal relevance
   - Mark at least one Treatment node as intervention_target = true
   - Ensure at least one Outcome node exists

2. **Edge Constraints**:
   - Define causal relationships between nodes as directed edges
   - Each edge must have a causal weight between -1.0 and 1.0 (magnitude indicates strength, sign indicates direction)
   - Classify edges as: Direct (直接), Indirect (间接), or Confounding (混淆)

3. **Path Constraints**:
   - Identify between {{MIN_PATHS}} and {{MAX_PATHS}} main causal paths
   - Each path should represent a complete causal chain from a Treatment node to an Outcome node
   - Path strength is the product of edge weights along the path
   - Classify paths as: FrontDoor (前门路径), BackDoor (后门路径), or Confounded (混淆路径)

4. **Output Format**:
   - Return your response as valid JSON only (no markdown code blocks)
   - Include reasoning explanation in the "reasoning" field
   - Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0) in the "confidence" field

## Output Schema

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "X",
      "name": "Variable name",
      "node_type": "Treatment|Outcome|Confounder|Mediator|Control",
      "importance": 0.8,
      "intervention_target": true
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "e1",
      "source": "X",

      "weight": 0.7,
      "edge_type": "Direct|Indirect|Confounding"
    }
  ],
  "paths": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "nodes": ["X", "M", "Y"],
      "strength": 0.56,

    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Explain your causal reasoning...",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

## Example Analysis

**Scenario**: A pharmaceutical company wants to understand the causal effect of a new drug (treatment) on patient recovery (outcome), considering potential confounders like age and pre-existing conditions.

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "X",
      "name": "Drug dosage",
      "node_type": "Treatment",
      "importance": 0.9,
      "intervention_target": true
    },
    {
      "id": "Y",
      "name": "Patient recovery",
      "node_type": "Outcome",
      "importance": 0.95,
      "intervention_target": false
    },
    {
      "id": "Z1",
      "name": "Patient age",
      "node_type": "Confounder",
      "importance": 0.7,
      "intervention_target": false
    },
    {
      "id": "M",
      "name": "Drug concentration",
      "node_type": "Mediator",
      "importance": 0.75,
      "intervention_target": false
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "e1",
      "source": "X",
      "target": "M",
      "weight": 0.8,
      "edge_type": "Direct"
    },
    {
      "id": "e2",
      "source": "M",
      "target": "Y",
      "weight": 0.7,
      "edge_type": "Direct"
    },
    {
      "id": "e3",
      "source": "Z1",
      "target": "X",
      "weight": 0.3,
      "edge_type": "Confounding"
    },
    {
      "id": "e4",
      "source": "Z1",
      "target": "Y",
      "weight": -0.4,
      "edge_type": "Confounding"
    }
  ],
  "paths": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "nodes": ["X", "M", "Y"],
      "strength": 0.56,
      "path_type": "FrontDoor"
    },
    {
      "id": "p2",
      "nodes": ["Z1", "Y"],
      "strength": 0.4,
      "path_type": "BackDoor"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The drug dosage (X) affects patient recovery (Y) primarily through drug concentration in blood (M), representing a front-door causal path. Patient age (Z1) confounds the relationship as it affects both drug dosage and recovery, creating a back-door path that needs to be controlled for in causal estimation.",
  "confidence": 0.88
}
```

## Guidelines

1. **Causal Direction**: Ensure edges represent plausible causal mechanisms, not just correlations
2. **DAG Structure**: Avoid creating cycles in the graph (unless representing feedback loops explicitly)
3. **Realistic Weights**: Assign causal strengths that reflect realistic effect sizes
4. **Domain Knowledge**: Use domain-specific knowledge when analyzing the scenario
5. **Simplicity**: Prefer simpler graphs with clearer causal chains over overly complex structures

Now, analyze the provided scenario and generate a causal graph following these guidelines.
